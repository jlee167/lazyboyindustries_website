        current work is closely related to self-driving, in which I was in charge of develping FPGA

        My area of interests include video/image processing, RF engineering,
        IoT, and education.

        Details of my current work and personal information is not available at

        My recent interests mostly concern to image processing.
        I have worked on/studied video compression standards like
        H264/H265/JPEG to develop open-source personal cameras

        Simple analog applications can also be designed except for complex RF applications.
        PCB with moderately complex routings (such as DDR3) or high speed requirements can
        be designed. You can refer to my portfolio with attached artworks to see my circuit designs
        and artworks.";

        peripherals and working experience with high speed peripheral drivers.";
