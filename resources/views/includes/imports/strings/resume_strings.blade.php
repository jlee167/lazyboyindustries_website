        related to self-driving, in which I was in charge of develping FPGA
        logic core and designing
        hardware.
        My area of interests include video/image processing, RF engineering,
        IoT,
        and education.

        My recent interests mostly concern to image processing.
        I have worked on/studied video compression standards like
        H264/H265/JPEG to develop open-source personal cameras
        with capabilities of 4K/FHD at affordable price.
        <br><br>
        One of my long-term project is FPGA-deployable H.264 Codec.
        Currently, RTL development and simulation is under progress.
        The results are months/years to come for now...";
